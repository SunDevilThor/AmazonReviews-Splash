0,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Overheating Tests and Preliminary Review vs. A7III.,3.0,"I just received this camera yesterday and ran a few heat-related tests. Here is a review based on my short time with it.I was excited for the Sony A7C, not because of its (slightly) smaller size but because it is essentially the same as the fantastic A7III, just without the annoying 30-minute record limit. Since almost everything I do with video is a ""long form"" event, I ran a few stress tests, and here are my first results. All video was shot in 100mbps 4K with a 20mm APS-C lens.First test: By a window, in the sun, with the LCD against the body.Lasted 41 minutes before overheating.Second test: By the same window but with the LCD open. Starting after 12 minutes of cooldown time.Lasted 11 minutes before overheating.Third Test: After 2hrs of cooldown time. In the shade (approx. 68F), screen open.Lasted 2hrs 9mins. Ran until battery died.Early Conclusions: The smaller body of the A7C isn't really much smaller than the A7III-- this is not a pocketable camera-- so what you're really getting is a cool throwback look, USB-C charging and fewer available buttons/ dials. Battery life is amazing (that one battery recorded 3hrs!) and the AF is of course perfect. Ultimately I'd recommend the A7III over this camera unless the 30 minute record limit matters to you. The A7III simply has a superior body design for real-world use."
1,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great full frame camera for travel,5.0,"Sony diversifies their Alpha 7 line based on the specific needs of camera enthusiasts - 7s (sensitivity) for video, 7r (resolution) for photo, and the plain old ""entry level"" a7 for a decent mix of the two. What we're seeing here is their next branch - 7c (compact) for travel. If you had to compare it to the a7iii - which is inevitable  because it reuses much of the same tech - it's not only smaller in size, but weighs less too. There are some compromises and improvements over the a7iii:Compromise:- Stabilization not the greatest- Lack of physical controls - no joystick, no front control wheel under power button, less custom buttons- Electronic view finder (EVF) not the greatest for photographers- Can't disable electronic front curtain shutter- Max shutter speed is 1/4000 vs a7iii 1/8000- Only 1 memory card slotImprovements- Flippy screen- Narrow body that works better on gimbals- Weighs less, about 20% lighter- Better color science- Improved shutter- Improved port covers- Better use of battery - more photos / videos per charge- More custom memory modes (3), better layout on mode selection dial- You can assign custom functions to 3 buttons and u/d/l/r on scroll wheel for a total of 7- Better autofocus in both photo and video- Continuous eye tracking autofocus in video- Works with Catalyst Browse for creating gimbal-like video footage in post- Dedicated video record button- No video recording limitsI think the disappointment you see from some people evaluating this camera is semi-justified in some ways (lack of 2nd card slot, poor EVF, less physical controls), but I also think many of them were expecting this to be the next iteration of the a7 series (a7iv). It's not. Nor is it meant to be - this is a new line with a new designation that has a built out target market in the micro four thirds / APS-C space. Sony took existing technology, improved upon it in so many ways, and put it in a smaller lighter package.The a7c is perfectly suited for travel, hiking, and vlogging in my opinion. With choice lenses, it has the potential to be lighter than my MFT system while offering all of the benefits that come with a full frame sensor. It's small / light enough that I don't mind taking it with me everywhere. If I wanted a higher end camera with a fuller set of features, I could invest in an a7r, a7s, a9, or FX6 and use the same lenses.If you already own an a7iii, you probably aren't going to see a huge benefit in switching to this camera. Hold off for the a7iv. But if you're coming from the APS-C or MFT space, you're a traveler, hiker, or vlogger that wants to maximize your image quality : weight/space ratio, you are the target audience for this camera. I'd highly recommend it!"
2,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),I've owned better cameras,3.0,"Pros:Great Battery Life (3hrs recording)No record time limitGreat AFGreat IQGreat Low LightFlip-out ScreenNo wheel locksCons:Fewer buttons than other FF camerasStill overheats in challenging conditions10MP APS-C stillI think the idea of making a small full frame camera body is silly since the lenses are so large. . The results are mostly the same great 4k video (and bad 1080p video) that the A7III produces, with fast AF and excellent low light. In tests performed I found that this camera lasted just over 40 minutes recording in the sun and was unlimited in the shade.  Ultimately, what you have here is a cool retro design that is less practical for use. It has a smaller body which can be handy but the effort it puts in isn't the best.  I rather have a bulky camera and see beautiful results....It does weigh very lightly and this is great for when your on the go and shooting.  I think this camera is great for Vlogging or taking quick videos."
3,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Powerful little beast,5.0,Sony definitely delivers with this compact camera. I just want to first start off saying that I’m an amateur photographer. So this is like my first camera ever. I just want to say for anyone who’s looking to buy a full frame mirrorless camera. Who doesn’t know much about how to use a camera. This is seriously the camera for you. Since this is my first camera I’ve been able to take what I think are great shots of my friends and family. I know the price point could be a little steep but I’m telling you it’s worth it.
4,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Revolutionary,5.0,"Finally, a full-frame interchangeable lens camera the size of a point-and-shoot, that uses adapters so you can shoot with almost any type of lens mount, and lenses out there.  This camera makes digital photography fun and practical. I use the A7C with a Leica M-Mount adapter in order to use my Leica lenses. The camera is set to silent shooting mode, and it becomes the quietest Leica street photography rig there is. It overall outperforms any Leica M body today, except for the prestige of using a Leica M camera."
5,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),A Sony A7RIII in the body of a Sony A6600! Lightweight and perfect for me!,5.0,"I love this camera! It's my first Full Frame Camera! I stream here on Amazon everyday and I use this camera plus the Sigma 35mm F1.2 lens as my main face cam for my streams I have lights behind me so the bokeh is just wow! I've used the Sony A7RII but it felt like it didnt have a lot of features this camera has and maybe the Sony A7RII needed to be updated as everything seemed so old with that camera! However I also own the Sony A6600, Sony A6000, and Sony A6100 I use them for my streaming and they're amazing but with my 35mm lens since it's a full frame lens on the cropped sensor cameras it was zooming way into my face with the Sony A7C I get the true 35mm! And it's amazing for streaming it makes face cam look dreamy with the back ground blur and bokeh behind me!I've only used this camera for taking photos once! I live in South Korea and it's winter now so it's too cold to go outside and shoot I took a few photos as you can see, I have Autumn photos of myself but I can't wait until it warms up again so I can take more photos! As for right now though I use it everyday to stream!If you have any questions about the camera and want to see it in use in real time stop by my Amazon stream you can find me by going to amazon.com/shop/atarabyte! Or heading to the Livestreams tab on Amazon! I stream everyday here on Amazon and I can compare all the Sony cameras I have for you in real time and hopefully help you decided which Sony camera would be best for you!I hope this review helps! And feel free to message me if you have any questions while I'm not streaming I would love to help! ^^Anyways, I hope you have an amazing day and if you do buy this camera I hope you love it as much as I do!"
6,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Small frame BIG power,5.0,"I’ve always wanted to jump on the Sony mirrorless hype train, but never had the opportunity to. On top of the size, the “silver” is a nice touch and I recommend that colorway to everyone in the market for it as it definitely adds a little flair to the camera to make it stick out from the usual all black camera bodies. The flip screen is a definite nice touch. I do wish that it had been touch screen, but the full motion is a nice touch. Definitely will help with selfies and vlogging if you do that. For me it is nice to be able to rotate and see what I’m shooting in weird angles. Speaking of seeing what you’re shooting, the Sony camera app allows you to see the EVF on your camera screen and capture as well! The kit lens is small and compact. Overall I don’t find much use for it as I hoped because I rarely shoot video or vlog, but if you do any of those, it is a definite must. It’s so compact and with it being 28mm on the wide end, you can get plenty of frame in your videos. The Auto-Focus is AMAZING. I’ve had plenty of shots messed up with other cameras because the Auto-Focus was off or too slow. Sony definitely has been the leader in the game and I’m happy to know the hype is well served. The A7C also has the newish Eye-AF feature. I haven’t had too much experience using it, but from my initial tests it is great and combined with the AF-C and zone focusing it is quick to switch and switch back to Eye-AF. Definitely an amazing feature. Overall this camera is great. If you’re looking for a small compact camera for vlogging/streaming with a flip screen, this is it. Or if you’re like me and just want a compact camera for all your travels (next year when covid is over), this is definitely it. Where previously I would have to think twice about taking my camera with me, this Sony A7C is a no brainer. It literally fits in my jacket pocket and is a take everywhere type of camera."
7,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Small a7iii,3.0,"Camera is great. It is like an a7iii with flip out button, continuous video recording, and smaller form factor. Miss the custom buttons though. However, if you pair this with a good small prime lens, this is great for street photography and vlogging. My only issue is the battery. I think i got a defective one as it is draining much faster than my older batteries i was using for my a7riii"
8,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),This is an amazingly competent camera,5.0,"We have had this camera since 1 June 2021and we purchased it to see if a compact full frame camera would work for us. We were looking for a smaller camera that was not an APS C sensor based camera.First a little background. My wife and I are keen semi professional photographers and own a Canon R5, Canon R6, Nikon Z6 II and Fuji X T4, along with a good selection of Canon RF, Nikon S Z and Fuji XF lenses. I have owned the Sony A7RIII and A7RIV and traded them for the Canon R5 and R6 cameras. We have been taking pictures for over 60 years in my case.I traded the Sony A7RIII and Sony A7RIV simply because I did not like taking pictures with them. Technically they were superb but they were difficult to handle and the new Canons (R5 and R6) were a revelation in handling and I 'wanted' to take pictures with them. I say this because I expected to dislike this A7C. It has the same menu system as the A7RIII and A7RIV (which I did not like) and the comments on the EVF and lack of controls in the reviews made me wonder why I wanted to try this.However it is the size that wins you over immediately. Picture quality is superb and autofocus is excellent. This is a full frame camera in the body of an APS C body and it handles exceptionally well. Somehow those awkward angles etc. of the bigger bodies goes away and it feels so good in both my wife and I's hands. I cannot confirm whether the autofocus is better than the A 7III but it seems the equal of the A 7RIII and A 7RIV, if not a little better (I do not have them to test them side by side but it certainly feels that way). In short we love this camera and, and this is the 'real' test, we tend to take it with us when we are looking to have a camera with us just in case.Pros:1. Small body that feels solid and beautifully made. Access doors are nice quality (not floppy rubber plug in pieces) and fully weather sealed.2. Excellent out of body JPGs, RAWS excellent and easy to recover detail in the shadows and highlights.3. Superb Autofocus that glues to your subject.4. Fast operation.5. Flexible 'flippy' screen.6. Access to a wide range of FE lens mount lenses.7. Kit lens is much better than you would expect and very small. Ideal for street photography and the one lens you might just happen to have with you.8. Excellent battery life.9. Excellent video output.10. In body image stabilization.Cons:1. The EVF is truly awful but just about allows you to aim the camera and take a picture when the rear screen is not viewable.2. Lack of a joy stick is an irritant to me,  but you get used to it.3. Kit lens 60 mm max focal length is too short and the wide angle is not wide enough (28 mm). An equivalent to that Canon RF 24 -105 f/4 - 7.1 would be wonderful.4. The Sony lenses are large for their capabilities (the F/4 24 -105 is enormous), Canon make smaller and better lenses for full frame. However Tamron are filling the gap. We have bought the F/2.8-5.6 28 to 200 mm Tamron for the A 7C and it is a good match, still not small but light and still easy to use and handle.5. IBIS not good enough for video, and needs a gimbal.We love this camera and we use it a lot (we have aleady taken around 4000 shots!!) and used it in a wide variety of conditions where it has excelled. Thoroughly recommended."
9,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Sony A7c: no limits full frame compact camera (if you know the options.........),4.0,"The A7c gives me access to next level low light video and photos. This is something that my m4/3 panasonic cameras (G9, G85) struggled to deliver, even just indoors on a sunny day with a nice f2.8 (or even 1.7) lens, the ISO could skyrocket. This was the main motivation for obtaining this camera, and it does not disappoint, with at least a 2-fold improvement in low light performance (max iso set to 3200 and usually sufficient for vids and photos). I am also very impressed by the featherweight budget samyang 18mm f2.8. After testing of many custom presets and getting to grips with some manual focus quirks,  I think I have an A7c  which can do just about everything I need  (stored in the 7 custom camera config preset slots). I can instantly make it into a deluxe GoPro (wide and everything always in focus), low light video Ap/Sp, astro timelapse, day timelapse, low light tracking auto focus stills......... Importantly, it is the same weight as a panasonic G85 which is critical for a travel/backpacking/bike camera (I need). I can put it on the crane M2 mini-gimbal for decent stabilization, and still be discrete/small enough to not feel like a sore thumb. This is the deal when you move from panny m4/3 - I swapped low light performance for effective stabilization. The catalyst giro stabe in post is a bit last resort, but a nice thought.  It is awesome to have access to the older manual FF lenses -  budget great glass - without all the crop factor PITA with m4/3 or APS-c. The big downside of this camera is lack of any intuitive user interface - it will do it all - but wow - it is quite a learning curve to test and set up this stuff. I guess you get out what you put in. As a panasonic G9  shooter (camera with very nice user interface),  the HUGE elephant in the room is usability and the lack of a touch screen. Compared to the G9 this camera has very poor organization and on-the-fly tweakability. The workaround here is extensive testing and the use of personal menus and custom presets, but even then the lack of a touch screen for at least review is just criminal. In summary, this camera really delivers full frame dazzle, is a good fit for light weight adventures (only with the additional M2 gimbal and lightweight lens), but IMO needs real commitment  from any non-sony shooter to get the preset settings dialed in and make it all work.9 month update --  removed a star to 4/5: in the end the lack of workable IBIS, touch screen and very fiddly menus caused me to give up with this camera.  For the way I shoot video (stopped down, lots of manual) the Sony AF was not as valuable as I expected. I found it was not so great at f>5, and with low contrast scenes (snow, landscapes).  I acquired a Panasonic S5, and so far its working perfectly for me."
10,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Masterpiece.,5.0,"I’ve been a photographer for over 30 years. This small camera body is an absolute powerhouse and is perfect for travel and can do everything that the larger Sony bodies can do. Great image quality in a lightweight and diminutive package.  A lot of people whine about not having enough buttons and dials, and as with any new piece of equipment, it’s up to the user to train themselves around it. I can’t find any faults with this setup at all, including the menus. Took me 15 minutes to figure it all out."
11,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),"Best Camera for $2,000",5.0,"The Sony Alpha 7c is by far the best camera I have ever owned.I love the retro style and duo color tone of Silver and black on the version I purchased. When it comes to photos, this camera has very precise colors and very good focus.I used to use a different brand and let me tell you, one of my pet peeves is when I hold down the shutter button and take multiple photos in quick succession, the other brand camera says please wait, and I cannot use the camera until it processes those images. Not this Sony! it has its own processing in the background, and just makes a queue, so you can continue to snap photos, and when you take a break, it just quickly copies them to the card! Absolutely amazing!I have not had the chance to test the microphone quality in a good setting, but from the little that I have tested it, this blows any other built-in camera on any other camera out of the water. Easily the best built-in camera I have ever used.The Sony A7c comes with a full-frame sensor which captures more light so you get this amazing depth of field, dynamic range and the detail is absolutely stunning.When you look at this camera compared to other professional cameras you are going to think it is less superior because it is half the size, BUT! do not despair! Sony has now moved into creating magic apparently, as this camera is by far better than its competition in half the size! This camera is so much lighter and smaller than most other cameras of the same quality, which makes this the perfect camera for all occasions!Videos are also very crisp with excellent lighting, and it shoots in 4k! I highly recommend this camera for anyone seeking a blog, YouTube channel, or just love photography!Video tutorial coming soon!"
12,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Awesome sensetivity; not just for lowlight,5.0,"Great camera. Autofocus is fast and as responsive as the sony a7R IV and the a6600. The real benefit over the aps-c lenses is in how the high sensetivity of the sensor lets you shoot. no one seems to mention this in the reviews, but its a lot easier to get a good photo with higher sensetivity because it dramatically increases the range of parameters where you can take a good photo. I like to shoot on manual, but let the camera automatically set the ISO. the exposure compensation dial and high sensetivity make it a lot easier to shoot this way than on either the a6600 or a7r iv. the higher sensetivity lets you decide to use faster shutter speeds and youre less likely to have too little light to use autofocus effectively. sure you lose resolution on an aps-c lens or dont have as high resolution as the a7r iv, but youre still above a 4k image, and the ease of acquiring an image in the moment is amazing."
13,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Exactly what I needed!,4.0,"Throughout the years I’ve owned the a7RII and the a6500 and this camera has combined to become the one camera body to rule them all for my uses. I always loved the size/weight of the a6500 but hated the crop sensor limits especially with available third party lenses. Well now I have a ultra compact FF camera body that is just as portable and discreet as the APS-C lineup of cameras which fits my needs perfectly.I am not a professional photographer or vlogger but just a casual photo hobbyist so this camera might not work for everyone and my views are coming from my level of experience. With that said there is one big thing that annoys me most about this camera vs the a7 lineup and that’s not having a front scroll wheel on the grip (that was stupid…why Sony…WHY?!) and far fewer customizable buttons vs the a6XXX lineup. Had Sony merged those two items into this camera body it would be a 5 star home run. I’m learning to live within the new limited perimeters of the camera itself and adapt to the different layout and lack of customization but it is a different experience than I was used to on both previous camera body setups.Anyway, if you can get passed those shortcomings and want a small body with a FF sensor then this is your only option. The small manual lenses that can be used with a cheap adapter available on eBay are plentiful and ultra cheap (Minolta 55mm f/1.7…..$40 on eBay) and having programmed a custom button for manual focus zoom and using focus peaking you can get excellent pictures that are incredibly sharp wide open with this camera. My general recommendation is for people to not be afraid to use manual focus lenses. Once you get used to them you can be just as fast as the autofocus on a Sony branded lens that is 5-20 times the price.Speaking of autofocus…the eye autofocus and autofocus abilities is the exact same tech as found in the a7SIII camera so it is incredible and according to reviews I’ve watched/read it is much improved over the competing a7III as well."
14,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Best Full-Frame Entry Level Camera Around,5.0,"For years I have been hesitant on joining the full-frame camera team because most full-frame's are so expensive! But then Sony released this bad boy, the Alpha 7C, and I have finally been able to experience a whole new world.I am a video content creator and the a7C has been life changing in just the few short weeks I used it. First, it's so easy to use. I was previously using a dslr camera for videos and I'm actually having an easier time with the settings on this camera. Everything you need is clearly on display and easy to access.Next, the focus on this compact is killer! So fast and you can control it through a variety of ways (ie. auto-focus, manual, face-priority, etc.). Quality you would expect from a bigger and more expensive device. You can easily produce stunning videos and images with the kit lens included.As a creator that will mainly be using the a7C for video, the flip-out screen is the real showstopper. It can easily be flipped and rotated to any way you need to get the perfect shot. Want to record an object? Check. Want to record yourself? Check. Want to record an overhead shot? Check. Want to record your adorable pet around the corner without waking them up from their fourth quarantine nap of the day? Check! The flip-out screen was what sold me to this camera. I won't ever be able to go back to using a camera without a flip-out screen.Also, the ability to record in 4K without a time limit.. bravo Sony!! There have been so many times where I've had to reshoot segments of videos because I ran over the usual 30 minute time limit on other cameras. But this little beast keeps recording until my memory card is full. A greatly welcomed addition for vloggers and unboxing creators.Overall the Sony Alpha 7C is a great camera for those that want to see what full-frame cameras are capable of and/or want to up their content creation game without breaking the bank.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
15,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great compact travel camera,5.0,"There are many technical reviews on this camera that is better than anything I can say here.  I wanted a camera mainly for video and would like to share how I came to chose the 7c.  There are lots of other choices, but this checks all the important marks that I was looking for.  I started fresh without any prior lens and accessories.  I first evaluated which brand and system of camera I want.  The industry is moving towards larger full frame sensors.  There's Sony, Canon, and Fuji.  I feel that Sony is the leader in product development and innovation.  So I went with them.  I could have bought the 7siii, but the 7c is much much more compact and at this point fits my need.  I could have chosen the a6600, but I think the full frames have better picture, especially in low light.  And is a better upgrade path towards other Sony full frames in the future.  I could have gone with a GH5, but that's a much larger camera with sucky focus and low light performance.  And though I like Canon, they don't have a full frame in this size.  They have better lens selection for sure, but I feel they are not quite as innovative.So for my compact video travel rig, I have the 7c with one set of lens...the Tamron 17-14mm.  For audio I bought the Sony eco-81m shotgun mic.  This mic operates in digital mode, and powers off the 7c battery so no extra cord or battery to worry about.  So far it's been the perfect system for me.  I do have larger hands so the grip is just a bit small.  I ended getting the Smallrig cage. I was worried this might add bulk to my system, but it fits like a glove and adds no perceivable bulk.  It adds protection as well as gives me a much better grip surface.I love my set up.  It has everything I want in a travel video camera."
16,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Compact full-frame and full-featured travel camera with great build quality and choice of lenses,5.0,"Sony's Alpha series is highly regarded by both professionals and enthusiasts. The 7C is a wonderful new entry in its product portfolio targeted towards vloggers, travel enthusiasts, influencers, or even professionals who would like to have an additional camera handy.It ticks many important boxes - light and well made, 4k video, compact mirrorless, full-frame, enough controls for the serious photographer, and compatibility with Sony's wide selection of E-mount lenses. External microphone and lights can be easily added, and a good quality company tripod should be fine.The form-factor on this is ideal for travel. I am still trying this out, but so far have been very happy with stills and video. This will definitely be my go-to outdoors and travel camera (when travel resumes). Highly recommended.Update 1 - I took the camera on a couple of local trips and love how easy it is to carry around. This is definitely much easier to carry around, both in dimensions and weight, compared to other DSLRs. I tend to shoot more because of this. You still have the full-frame capabilities capturing excellent photos and videos. The a7c is perfectly suited for travel, hiking, and vlogging with great autofocus and continuous eye tracking. The kit lens (28-60) does an adequate job with portrait stills and bokeh shots when traveling light, but thanks to Sony's extensive range of high-quality E-mount lenses I have also paired it with some Sony G Master series lenses for even better photo results. The audio capture is good and it's easy to add an external travel mic for pro results.  Pasr19"
17,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Excellent for its design!,4.0,"Bought this not too long ago and I was a Sony Alpha 7R II user. I believe Sony's design vision came out great. I thought back then that A7R2 will be my camera for a while but as I grow as a photographer, I realized that the weight and the AF system were not my taste anymore. I couldn't really go to APS-C because, the 35mm sensor size simply gives honor to film sizes and I respect that. Imagine, a (relatively) smaller form factor, with full-frame image size capability, enough superb resolution (24MP) for current viewing/display technology (and possibly in the coming years later) and competitive color science. All packed in A7C. Not to mention, great battery life. The price could've been cheaper, for all the compromises done. Lesser buttons? Not a big deal; loss of quality of life I suppose. One can always master their gear and be faster in changing settings than anyone else, no matter how less of buttons there are. In note of color science, I shoot RAW so it is irrelevant to me. If I want to better color, I'll work the image in post processing. I'd say Sony Alpha 7C is Excellent for its design! But in the end of the day, only yourself can decide which to purchase; you have to be sure how is it going to be used for anyway."
18,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Not impressed,2.0,This is a wonderfully adequate camera.  The kit lens feels cheap and plastic.  The body is better.  I have found the A7iii a better buy.  The camera really does not have a small camera feel.  Nothing really impressive for the money.
19,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),"Nice smaller & lighter, great for travel and day trips",4.0,"The Sony Alpha 7C takes great crisp clear photos & video.  I love the smaller size, it makes it so much easier for making videos.  The smaller size also makes it easier to use on smaller tripods like I use for my unboxing videos, so I can get close up.  Since it is also lighter it will make it easier to use on a hand held device for my outdoor videos opposed to the large DSLR I have tried to use.  I am really impressed with the quality and ease of use of this Sony Alpha 7C.  I am also in love with being able to change out the lenses, that makes it so versatile for the different types of videos that I make.  Anything from content creating to my own personal family fun videos & cooking videos.  It is a great little camera and very versatile.  I can't wait to get a couple more lenses and really do more with it.  I think the Sony Alpha 7C is going to make a great travel camera as well.  It will be easier to pack and carry in my bag instead of having to carry an extra bag with my larger heavy DSLR."
20,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Small and mighty! Amazing full frame camera,5.0,"Wow I feel like I am emerging from the Stone Age! This camera has amazing features and makes taking amazing shots and videos a breeze. I had heard a lot about the Sony mirrorless cameras but hadn’t had a chance to try one out but with the release of the A7c it was the perfect balance of price and features that I had to go for it! The real time tracking autofocus system is truly amazing and very fast allowing for fast capture of clear shots. I also really liked the 4K video recording and the inputs for a mic and headphones allowing clean audio recording with the video. This would be a great camera for anybody looking to take amazing photos and videos on the go. The size is great for travel it is almost pocketable and the kit lens has a great range. The collapsable zoom lens helped keep the form factor small and balanced with the size of the camera. I loved the silver and black color scheme for its retro feel but with modern technology. Coming from a APS-C camera, the amount of details and the dynamic range that is captured by this full frame is amazing. I didn’t think it would be that big of a difference but I can really tell the difference it image quality between this full frame and my old APS-C. The bokeh is mind blowing! No portrait mode on a phone can compete, the software makes it very easy to get studio quality results and always gets the subject in focus with the right amount of background blur. I would highly recommend it for any beginner photographer or somebody who travels a lot and wants something that can be tossed into and bag or large jacket pocket. You really can’t beat the size of this camera especially with a full frame lens, it’s almost the same size as the old digital point and shoots we all used to have."
21,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Fantastic little full frame,5.0,It has the full frame image quality that I was after at a smaller size compared to the A7iii. Fantastic battery and great lineup of lenses. I only wish it had the new and improved menu system that the A7siii has.
22,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great Portable Camera. Lots in a (relatively) small  package,5.0,"This camera is spectacular. I am a casual photography enthusiast. I thought I'd use this camera to shoot more food / cocktail photography but instead I've been using it for portrait and animal photography over the holidays. I've used the video to film fireworks and family time to put the camera to the test in different situations and scenarios. I've tested the camera in motion and in night with mostly stills and briefly used the video.Below is my comprehensive review of the Sony A7CAesthetic and Body: Absolutely beautiful casing with a retro feel. The silver and black feels like I'm shooting on a gorgeous vintage leica with a fuller body, The weight is actually incredible. So light to carry around. I've shot on a DSLR traditionally and am surprised at how much this camera delivers in the size of its body. It's got a great ergonomic grip that allows for stable shooting. Huge Kudos to Sony on the design of the a7c. Some have said that the viewfinder seems small, I disagree. It is perfectly ergonomic and fits the architecture of the camera. The built in level helps retain crispness on the shots.Still photography: Truly remarkable and sharp pictures. I have not used this semi professionally yet and have used it mostly for family gathering over the holidays for enthusiast shooting. The ISO 50 to ISO 204800 give the camera pretty much nightvision. It's insane. The features on the 28-60 lens are sharp and crisp. It also is quite easy to create a lot of bokeh. It does take some getting used to to ""flatten"" your images.Video: shoots at 120FPS makes for Seamless and incredibly smooth filming. Once again that ISO even in incredibly dimly light areas produced flawlessly smooth filming. It's absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to start using this camera more seriously.All in all, this camera is amazing. It has everything I've looked for as a casual enthusiast photographer. I am learning how to use this camera properly, and am so impressed with what I've been able to produce so far with it."
23,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Smallest and lightest Full-frame camera I owned,5.0,"I was lucky to receive as early Christmas gift the A7c basic kit with the FE f/4-5.6 / 28-60mm lens. I previously owned a Sony a230, that I switched for a ""semi-pro"" compact camera from an other brand.First of all, I have to admit, I am highly satisfied with this impressively ""tiny"" full frame camera. What you have to know before buying: It's a E-mount and FE lens are highly recommended (and pretty expensive but worth every penny you invest in it). If you are a vlogger or that photo is your hobby, but you always felt that DSLR are too big or too heavy, go for this piece of mirrorless art.I am very impressed how fast I got used to the new options, and how easy taking decent picture was. The bokeh with the basic lens is pretty ok and I like how the auto mode was very fast and reliable. I do feel that it's a pretty premium entry camera for beginners who wants to make a serious (or not so serious) hobby out of this camera.I use it essentially for my Instagram content or for some other personal/professional projects too. I do miss something from it. Due to its size, one of the control dial is missing. I like to have one on the front of the camera.My lens selection is the following (hobby, dog lover and astrophoto lovers with the basic kit lens set):- The light telephoto option - Sony 70-300 mm, f/4.5-5.6- Astro photo and wide angle: Sony 24 mm, f/1.4I am now feeling that I have to invest in new lenses especially for astrophoto. I will update the review after the next hiking session I will do with my new Sony 24mm f/1.4 ."
24,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),A full frame beauty hidden in a compact body,5.0,"There is a lot to be said about this camera. It has the full-frame goodness incorporated in the form factor of an Aps-c body. That means you are more likely to carry it with you everywhere, especially when traveling. Being a full-frame you have the ability to purchase some really nice Sony lenses, of course, some of them are really big and would make this not as compact. The viewfinder is just not pleasant to use. A compromise when trying to trim everything down. I love the articulating touch screen! If you want to make a 4K video on Youtube this is perfect. If you want to vlog on the go then you might prefer a wider lens but that would make the setup a bit heavier and clunkier. It can be done though. The menu screen does not have touch functionality. When closed you can have the screen facing inwards so as to keep it safe. The menu system is the older version, who knows if they will update to Sony’s newest version. It is missing a couple of dials and buttons: No joystick and most of the buttons will have to be used with your right thumb. It only has 1 SD card slot, a bit of a bummer if you wanted to use it as your main wedding or gig camera. Great autofocus and they were able to pack-in IBIS into the body, impressive for the size. This is really where I was floored, the camera helps you not miss that shot or keeps it from being blurry. Love that! Battery life is awesome. You get weather sealing, just make sure the lenses you purchase have that feature as well. I easily transferred files over to my smartphone via wifi/Bluetooth that the camera offers. Overall, this is a very nice camera for traveling or if you really want and need the articulating touch screen. You are going to have to spend a premium for that though. You are paying for the image quality of a full-frame sensor and the compact size versatility that the other Sony models don't offer. After seeing the images this camera produces, even the JPEGS, you will probably fall in love with it as I did. I added some straight out of camera jpegs. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
25,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Best Camera for Your Lifestyle,5.0,"Best Camera for Your LifestyleThis is the best camera for recording your lifestyle and express yourself. Sony Alpha 7C is the most compact full-frame mirrorless available in the market. Its lightness and well-balanced body help you carry it wherever you go without any second thought. Its uncompromising capability and quality let you obtain the highest quality images and videos anywhere and at any moment. I would recommend this camera for people who want to upgrade from crop body, serious about recording your lifestyle, content creator, professionals who need a second body.Swivel screenThis is the second Sony full-frame camera with an articulating screen. Another one that has this screen costs much more. It changes the game in the sense that you have much more freedom in your shot angle and also monitor yourself for the self-shot without any other accessories.Sony Auto Focus TrackingAutofocus and Video focus tracking are out of this world. You will not sacrifice shots that are out of the focus. Especially, Auto tracking enabled in the video makes this camera best for the Vlog. The enhancement on the screen brightness is an upgrade from a7m3. Some suggest viewfinder is a downgrade, but I had no problem with it. I also like how detail you can adjust focus transition speed to make it more cinematic. I wanted it to have an updated Sony menu system, but it has the previous generation touch menu system with a menu button in a weird location.Video reliabilityThis is also a great camera for video recording with unlimited video recording minutes. You can make a professional-quality video for any type of conference or lecture. I see this can be even a great sub-camera for the professionals to have that reliable second and third view of the recording.New Compact bundle LensSony created a new FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 compact lens to go in hand with Sony A7C. I took several shots with this lens and it was a pleasant surprise. I usually do not have any high hopes for the bundled lens and especially the small lens. However, this produces great quality images. The compact lens size and lightness draw you to use it more often than you think."
26,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),"Full-frame photos in a super compact body, as amazing as the quality lenses you put on it",5.0,"I own the much more expensive Sony a7s III for video but upgraded from a Sony A7 III to this A7c for photos for the resolution. That resolution is big enough to crop in on things like the moon without much quality loss. I think this camera is an amazing compact replacement for the a7 III. With quality lenses you'll get amazing results! The included photos were all with the 100-400GM, some shots with the 2x teleconverter.The only 2 major drawbacks to this camera is that it really should have 4k 60 video at this point. It should have also received the nicer new menu system as the a7S III as it was released after it. I don't think those are deal breakers, since I couldn't rate 4.5 my rating is 5 stars."
27,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),This is a superior full frame camera in a small package,5.0,"I love this camera and have used it for landscape, flowers (with the Sony 90mm macro), and running children (with the Sony 85mm f1.8).  The autofocus is top of the line and the eye focus is excellent too.  Even the kit lens, the 28-60mm that comes with this camera, is surprisingly sharp and very useful.  Really a great job Sony has done putting a big sensor in a small camera."
28,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Looking for your first full frame camera? Look no further,4.0,"Stepped to this camera from a Canon M50 and man was it an incredible upgrade! If you're like myself and didn't want to go all out on the latest and greatest any of the brands have to offer, then this is a great ""budget"" alternative. Yes $1,800 is still a lot of money, but it's the cheapest full frame camera you can buy new. I'm primarily a video shooter with the occasional photo shoot and this camera is really a fantastic for hybrid shooters. After using this camera for a few months, I see why people rave about Sony image quality is absolutely amazing and is plenty of camera for beginners to not only start with but also grow with!"
29,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Light weight and excellent new compact zoom lens,5.0,Light weight and excellent compact zoom lens. Excellent autofocus. I own an A9 and the A7c is very very good. If you value light weight and sharp pictures you will love it. Be advised however that the viewfinder could be better and you will need to adapt to having fewer physical controls - not a problem for me.
30,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),The Perfect Camera,5.0,"This is the perfect all-around camera and lens setup for me. I like to be minimalist with my tech, and I found that this camera is the smallest one that can do everything I want, and everything I imagine most people could want. It's got a mic and headphone jack, it's full-frame, weather-sealed, has a touch screen, no known major overheating issues, no video record time limit, good battery life, just perfect for me. I bought the body only, but actually bought the kit lens on eBay afterward because I read up about it and it's actually awesome (I don't usually do kit lenses which is why I initially didn't buy this one). Thanks Sony for making this camera, it's a move in the right direction for sure. Thanks for packing so many features into such a small body."

49,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great compact full-frame camera,5.0,"I was debating between the A7iii and this camera and ultimately decided on the A7C. Ultimately I wanted something that was compact yet provided the image quality of a full frame camera. I’ve had full sized DSLRs in the past and I noticed that the size and cumbersome nature of carrying them around deterred be from taking the camera with me. With the A7C, the compact size really makes me more prone to stick it in a bag and take it wherever I go. Also, the updated autofocus system really tipped the scale in favor of the A7C.I plan on primarily using prime lenses so the whole “large lens on a small body” argument doesn’t much apply to my situation.As far as functionality and the loss of dials/custom buttons, it’s not a situation that is going to be of any major detriment to anybody using this camera. Yes, you lose out on some conveniences, but you can still set customizations and use the quick function menu to get to the controls you need. Obviously if you’re going to be doing professional work, the other alpha models will better suit your needs, but I this camera isn’t necessarily geared towards those people so we shouldn’t be holding it to those standards.The flip out screen is nice, though I’m agnostic when it comes to this feature as I don’t plan on vlogging. However, if I were to this would be an absolute must. It does serve as a nice feature when I’m taking photos from difficult angles.Battery life is fantastic. Build quality is very solid. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase and I’m looking forward to snapping a lot of photos with this little beast."
50,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),C for compact. The A7iii goes on a diet.,5.0,"Sony has taken their hugely popular A7iii and sent it to the plastic surgeon with a photo of an A6500 with directions of ""get a body like that!"" The result after some miniaturization is called the A7C... the C is Sony code for ""compact"", although cool, crazy or cute can apply too - but cheap certainly does not.I found my C lightly used for a shade over $1500, and after shooting it for several weeks, I can tell you... situationally, it's a quality-of-life improvement over previous A7 bodies, depending entirely on your priorities. If you've got an A7iii today, it's a lateral option, not a clear upgrade.IQ is identical to my amateur eyes to the A7iii, which is to say, delicious 24 megapixel RAW and JPEG files and decidedly jazzed up colors from earlier Sonys. Sony isn't FujiFilm, but looking at the JPEG color science on the Mark 3 and 4 bodies, versus the OG A7 from 2013... it's significantly improved, particularly on the skin tones. Shutter sound is a bit different from the A7iii, personally I like it better - a satisfying, precise chunk-chunk.The tilt-screen on the A7iii was nice, the flippy-screen on the A7C is better. A lot of people will scoff and call it a vlogger feature - in reality it's just enjoyable flexibility - not to mention protecting the display when you're living on the EVF. Touchscreen seems a tad more responsive than the A7iii's touch-to-focus setup. Alas, the C does not get the A7Siii's revamped, touch responsive menus (and likely won't ever get them, since it has the A7iii's processor).Sony has abandoned the soft plastic ""port flaps"" on the A7iii and given the A7C ports proper hinged doors, and that is very welcome and will improve long-term reliability. The viewfinder relocates from top-side to left-side, which might upset left-eyed 'togs but I'm right-eyed, so no surprise, I rather enjoy the rangefinder configuration. The III's viewfinder is more comfortable and indisputably larger, but the C's is perfectly usable in the bright Florida sun. Oddly the SD card slot is on the left, and to go smaller, the 2nd card slot is gone, so is the ancient Micro-USB B port... it's all USB-C from here on out. Many will miss that 2nd card slot, but no one will miss the old USB port.Other features are there like you've come to expect from the A7iii, it handles high ISO about equally well to the A7iii, 12000 and it's not breaking much of a sweat, but starts to show a lot near 25k and above, depending on shooting conditions.Losing the front exposure dial and some of the custom buttons is the most painful adjustment... you can use the 2 rear dials in tandem for Shutter/Aperture control in M, but the utility of the front dial is missed from time to time. Some have said the IBIS is poorer on the C than the III, I cannot duplicate this in my shooting of either (I don't own any lens with its own stability control), the III and C seem to be about the same. Autofocus seems to be much like the III, eye AF catches my kids and very hyper puppy without any issues whatsoever. I’ve read Sony improved it, rest assured, it’s working great.I got the A7C as a body-only, so I haven't tried Sony's adorable little 28-60 kit zoom, but by all accounts, it's a much better lens than the aging 28-70 kit zoom glass you'd get on the III and other A7s.I most often shoot the A7C with a Samy 35 2.8 pancake, the Sony 85 1.8 prime 💚 or the Tamron 28-200. Even with the gorgeous and largish Tam superzoom, the entire package is a far easier fit in the backpack for a day at the zoo or Disney World than the A7iii - and a little lighter on the shoulder. It feels like packing a crop system versus a legacy A7 model, for sure.I think Sony is drawing a line in the sand. A lot of A6400/6500/6600 shooters are keenly eyeing this one and the full-frame ecosystem, and a lot of A7ii shooters and those on aging Canikon “Costco DSLRs” too, I'd imagine. Yes there are gigantic Gmaster lenses that negate the size improvements on the A7C, but Samyang and Tamron are making some smaller full-frame lenses that are super compelling and priced quite aggressively.At $1798 MSRP body only, it's presently a steep ask... this isn't $999, an A7iii with promotional discounts often comes out cheaper and offers some features (and arguably some drawbacks) that the C doesn't. That being said, the C is smaller and lighter, significantly in some directions... losing the EVF hump top-side does make a difference in the camera bag. The C is chunkier than an A6000, but not especially larger than an A6500.Inevitably, when the A7C with kit glass makes it way down to $1598 with promotional discounts, think Black Friday 2021... it's going to become the de-facto Sony full-frame for the price-conscious who wants a little more than an A6XXX series delivers. Not many A7R or A7S shooters are going to consider this a primary, but for the new mom/dad, or aspiring Youtuber, or hobbyist on a budget who wants to dip their toes into full frame, this is a really nice option to have."
51,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Small and quality image.,5.0,"I'm a Nikon photographer for 5 years. This time I switch to Sony mirrorless full frame, which I've been waiting for so long because I was not ready. The reason I chose this one over A7iii or others is its size, so tiny, like a beginner point and shoot camera, with professional image quality. I also do vlogging, and this flip screen is perfect. Auto focus is quick like iPhone. I love using the peaking focus assist feature too. Some people might argue that this camera is lacking a lot of buttons or key features compare to higher end Sony camera, but for me, if we spend time get to know the camera, we can take the perfect photos."
52,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Love it but..,5.0,"I'll start out with the Cons since most of you know all the Pros that come with the camera.  A little about me first, I'm a avid hobbyist and have been shooting with Nex-5n, Nex-6, a5100, a6300, and a6500 for the better of the last 6 years.  I'm a huge fan of the compact alpha line from Sony which explains why I've waited so long in upgrading to full frame.  Finally this camera was announced so I jumped on it.  And overall I love it.  However, there have been a few surprises.First.  No flash.  I didn't know this.  I didn't read about it on any review and didn't notice is was missing a flash anywhere until I had it in my hands.  Granted I have external flashes so it's not a huge set back and I totally understand there are sacrifices that need to be made when making a full frame camera so small therefore I'm not taking a star away from it.Second, Just as I expected, I'm not loving the new screen.  I'm aware there is more potential from a screen like this especially with selfie mode, but I prefer the older style.  Let's say you're recording video, and you lower the camera to about knee height.  With an a6500 you can just flip up the screen with any of your fingers while recording. Very easy.  On this one, it takes more work to get that angle.  Not something you can do easily while shooting a video and trying to keep it steady at the same time.  I recommend you pop out the screen before starting to record. As I mentioned, it's not a huge set back since there's more potential from this screen so I'm not docking it a star either.  In fact, I think the screen is a hair bigger than the old one which is cool.Third.  I don't see a way to record video in MP4.  I transfer 90% of what I shoot straight through my phone through the app, and unless it's in mp4 my phone won't register the file.  But maybe I'm missing something, I've only had it for a week.  So I'm not docking it a star either. Especially since I'm keeping the a6500 for video and using this one strictly for pictures.4. the viewfinder does not come with an eyecup (why on earth? I don't know.  although it's the same size as the evf on my a6500, it feels smaller because there's no eyecup.  I don't feel that's enough of a reason to deduct a star, I really want to because that's a pretty big deal, but the camera still deserves 5 stars.5. There aren't short cut buttons.  usually Alpha camera have about 3.  This one doesn't have any.  I've actually never used them before but I'd love to use it on this one to short cut super 35mm option and get more range from the same lens without having to go through the menu.Overall I love the camera and I'm super stoked about it.  In case you're wondering it's a bit thicker and heavy (which his expected) from a6xxx line and I'm ok with that.  I'm learning something new every day and look forward to actually printing something new I take with this camera."
53,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Kind of succeeds at it's purpose but...,4.0,"I recently moved to an area with beautiful mountains, hiking everywhere. My only FF camera is a Panasonic S1 which I LOVE..but it is rather huge and heavy..hence for my new life with so much to explore..this A7C really caught my attention because of its small size and weight. In the past I have owned the A7S, A7RIII, RX1RII. That said, though I shoot raw and jpeg, I kind of hated Sony color science esp skin tones..not always, but overall.  Because of jpeg skin tones and overall handling, I eventually sold all my Sonys little by little. Obviously Sony keeps improving EVERYTHING, including color science, their auto focus is second to none.  My life story aside..so in Utah where I now live, the sun is super bright and strong. My first day of shooting while doing an easy hike up a mountain was a good test for the A7C. I heard over and over how almost useless the evf was but didn't believe it. In bright sunshine..yes it's rather hard to see anything thru it, and the lcd screen was rather dim too. However as to the A7C's purpose of being light and easy to take with you...I do have to give it 5 stars. Also I was blown way by the 20-60 kit lens as to sharpness and overall IQ. I only used the A7C for photography not video re: this review. When I got home I was excited to see my first batch of pictures. For the most part image quality esp considering I used the kit lens, was awesome. Indeed colors looked better to me than my prior Sonys..didn't have the old orangey skin thing that Sony's seem to do a lot. However and I suppose this could happen with any camera, most of my photos had a very dark dust spot in the upper right hand corner of every picture. Of course I can fix them all in post..but I only took all of 100 pictures  or so since owning the Sony. I did not swap out lenses and it was a calm day with almost no wind. The fact that the sensor already got dust on it was a real drag for me. Also I skipped this but, I DID miss having the extra customization buttons aka the A7III and my biggest bad...the ""A7III is really not THAT much larger than the A7C."" So why give up all those controls? In that way for photography I prob could have gotten away with the A7III with that tiny kit lens..or perhaps a small prime like one of the sigmas for small size and less weight. Back to the dust issue...I hated to do it..got the hand blower out and tried to remove the dust.  I FIRST tried using the built in sensor cleaner which did nothing. In fact the blower KIND of worked..the dust spot was no longer there..but seemed to have moved to another pat of the sensor..Obviously this should not be a deal breaker, and the cause was PROB the plastic kit lens that sucked in some dust.  Maybe the dust didn't help, I started just getting the overall feeling this A7C is jut not worth it's price tag. Just kind of a cheap overall feeling..and the dust spot sure didn't help my feeling of quality control or 2k I just spent. I decided to return it as I'm not going to try and use a wet sensor swab cleaner on a brand new camera.. As to VIDEO well this may indeed be a great camera...Though as mentioned, the LCD was rather dim outdoors for vlogging so that's not good. For photography if you choose carefully, you can get a rather small FF camera not THAT much larger than the A7C, but with more buttons for direct customization control, be it even another Sony body, or in my case changing it for a semi light, compact new Panny S5 with a small 20-60 lens...the A7C is just not worth it's price-tag IMO, it exudes a sort of cheapness overall..if that's a word. :) To be fair though, being so lightweight, is something Sony WANTED to do..so my cheapness comment? was just MY feeling about this camera."
54,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Perfect adventure camera!,5.0,"I am an adventure photographer always on the go up and down mountains. That being said I take into consideration everything that I'm carrying in order to make the trip comfortable and even possible. The Sony A7C has a lot less weight, but is definitely not less of a camera! It has all of the greatest qualities from previous Alpha line cameras jammed into its fun size!"
55,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Love it!,5.0,I love this camera so much! The quality is clear and it gets some really great shots!!! It really made my love for filming grow. I love that it is easy to take around with you and so portable. The design is very cool and I love that it has a retro look. It really is the best camera i ever brought!!! I am so excited to tell my friends and family about it and make cool videos for them! The price is a little much but it is well worth it for such a great camera! I think the size of the camera is perfect and it’s easy to hold! Perfect for on the go! It can certainly adapt to any environment that I am in if I’m moving around or just sitting still! I love the full frame high image quality which is something I never got before in my other cameras! I really love the bokeh features gives my video a softer feel. I love the AI tech behind it! Really cutting edge! The audio is so clear! All in all a really great camera!

56,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Improves on the A7iii in a smaller form factor,5.0,"Focusing on the actual experience I have, especially compare to sony's own full frame in the same price point which I still think is the gold standard for this price point.--It is light, especially pairing with the kit lens. You WILL notice the weight different vs the other sony camera w/ 28-70.--Yes, the view finder although small didn’t seem to take long to get used to.--The 28-60 kit lens is very sharp and feels greatly balanced with the weight of the camera. The Lens vs the 28-70 I used to compare with the A7iii seems to be on point.--Real time tracking, is amazing for Vlogging or streaming. Add that to the 3 hours you get with the battery, no Time limit on recording! For vlogging having this and the LCD be able to face me is a game changer.--Almost every buttons are customizable, except menu, playback and shutter. Although the shutter speed is lower I felt it was better in comparison. Not sure if its due to newer firmware or what but felt better.--Flip screen is a game changer with what my use case is (streaming set up for my PC and vlogging)This camera is perfect if you want to travel light, pack light and mostly using a small lens"
57,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great for Vlogging!!,5.0,"I love this camera. It’s everything you want in a Sony a7iii and more. Plus the size is amazing. The 120fps in 1080p is amazing and extremely clear. I do wish it had the new menu system like the Sony a7Siii. Overall, I love this camera."
58,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Mini A7 III,5.0,"****READ****Coming over from Nikon and Canon..I'll keep it short and sweet. It's a very good camera offering most of the specs of the a7iii in a mini body. Mostly everything about this camera is great but it's not perfect and here's why. The grip isn't that solid, feels like it might slip, the eyefinder is small and off centered, much like the a6000's line. It's a pain to shoot fully manual, your thumb will be doing most of the work. But the biggest downfall, only one card slot. All the downfalls aside I don't regret buying it, the auto focus is amazing! Top notch. Flawless. The menu system is simple, easy to use, beautiful FF picture quality of course(even the Jpegs look great although I'd recommend shooting RAW). It's light, small, compact."
59,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),I love this camera! Coming from A7R2,5.0,"I have had an A7R2 for a few years. I am not a professional photographer - I am a consumer who wants gorgeous photos of his family! The A7R2 was great but it was (1) slow, (2) bulky and (3) had UHS-I memory.Switching to the A7C has been awesome. The camera is super fast, has an incredible auto-focus, is compact and has very fast memory. I went from my camera being a tool I take out on special occasions to something I can carry with me daily. I paired the A7C with a 24-105 F4 lens and they fit great in the 3L or 5L Peak Design bag.Love this camera, could not be happier!"
60,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Great camera! Not that much smaller!,5.0,"I got this with the lens for traveling, I really like it thus far! It is very similar to the a7III (which I also have), but without two SD card slots and a little smaller. Sony has also improved the feel and the buttons of their cameras! The swivel screen is also great on a fullframe! Overall, cute, small camera and lens duo!"
61,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Wow... Have I found the perfect travel camera?,5.0,"I've been searching for something that would allow me to take high quality photos and still be light and compact for trips. While my phone does a wonderful job, I wanted the option of different lenses for different scenarios. I'm excited to share that the Sony Alpha 7C is just that camera. it is really light and fits comfortably in my fanny pack, but more importantly the pictures it takes are simply gorgeous. I can't recommend this product enough!"
62,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),camera,2.0,"the blues are horrible especially the skies ,also the files wont get much editing"
63,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Best compact full frame,5.0,Compact full frame in hand. Bought one month ago from Best Buy. Best video for vloggers with no time limit. Only thing little less grip to catch with hand but negligible. I like flip screen very much. Best picture quality than aps-c cameras.
64,Sony Alpha 7C Full-Frame Compact Mirrorless Camera Kit - Silver (ILCE7CL/S),Sony's newest full-frame didn't disappoint,5.0,"First thing to note is that this is NOT meant to be a camera for ""everyone"" - it really depends on a few things ... are you stepping up to full-frame for the first time and are you only used to point and shoots vs. a pro photographer who uses a lot of custom keys? What camera are you currently using? Are you already invested in the Sony camera/lens ecosystem or moving over from, say, Canon? How important is compactness and size?For me, this camera replaces an A7II. IF I had an A7III, I'm not sure this is worth replacing (nor do I think Sony is focusing on this group). A few quick first observations:*  Build quality is what you expect from Sony* Eye AF/focusing speed is a total game-changer for me, coming from the A7II* Battery life is much better (again, coming from the weaker battery)Overall, love this camera and it meets my needs well (enthusiast) for what it is. Really enjoying its capabilities!"
